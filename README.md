### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paula - scientist turned data scientist known for ðŸ’›-ing data [I've talked about it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XvD83yhe3E). 

Here you find a collection of my repositories featuring my personal data projects [I've talked about it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8islIa40Do), like:

  - [First Words](https://github.com/pga99/First_words): The analysis of the 1000 first words of my bilingual child
  - [Boardgame AK](https://github.com/pga99/Adventskalendar_boardgames): An Adventskalendar made out of graphs with boardgame results data
  - [Our boardgame predictor](https://github.com/pga99/our_boardgame_play_predictor): The model put it an streamlit app to predict who will win in a particular boardgame

Here I also host the [Science Comics](https://github.com/pga99/comics) I've created for the [Bertalanffy Lecture Series at COS](https://www.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/de/centre-for-organismal-studies-heidelberg/wissenschaftliche-veranstaltungen/bertalanffy-lecture-series-at-cos).
